# x402 Shopify App

### Bringing Movement Network's Lightning-Fast Payments to 4.4M+ Shopify Stores

## 🎯 The Problem
Traditional e-commerce is stuck in Web2. AI agents and crypto-native users can't seamlessly purchase products from Shopify stores and Movement Network's speed and efficiency can't reach the millions of merchants on Shopify.

## ✨ Our Solution
A Shopify app that bridges Web2 commerce with Web3 payments using the x402 v2 protocol on Movement mainnet.
