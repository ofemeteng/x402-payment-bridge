# x402 Shopify App

### Bringing Movement Network's Lightning-Fast Payments to 4.4M+ Shopify Stores

## 🎯 The Problem
Traditional e-commerce is stuck in Web2. AI agents and crypto-native users can't seamlessly purchase products from Shopify stores and Movement Network's speed and efficiency can't reach the millions of merchants on Shopify.

## ✨ Our Solution
A Shopify app that bridges Web2 commerce with Web3 payments using the x402 v2 protocol on Movement mainnet.

## 🌐 Try the Live Demo

**Live Storefront**: [https://testnow-4.myshopify.com/apps/x402-checkout](https://testnow-4.myshopify.com/apps/x402-checkout)

### 🔐 Important: Test Store Password Protection

This is a Shopify development store, which requires password protection per Shopify's policies. Here's what to expect:

**First Visit:**
1. You'll see a Shopify password page
2. Enter password: `ofreil`
3. Shopify will redirect you to the main store homepage (this is default Shopify behavior)
4. **Manually navigate back** to: `https://testnow-4.myshopify.com/apps/x402-checkout`

**Subsequent Visits:**
- You'll go directly to the x402 checkout (password is remembered)
- Full customer experience as intended

> **Note for Judges**: This password step is a Shopify development store requirement and would NOT exist on a production store. Live Shopify stores (like those of the 4.4M+ merchants) have no password protection and would load the x402 checkout directly on first visit.

### 💳 To Complete a Test Purchase:

1. Browse products from the live Shopify catalog
2. Click "Buy with x402" on any product
3. Install [Nightly Wallet](https://nightly.app/) if you don't have it
4. Connect your wallet
5. Review the x402 v2 payment request
6. Sign the transaction on Movement Network
7. See your order created in real-time!

**What You'll Need:**
- Nightly Wallet browser extension
- Small amount of MOVE tokens on Movement Network (for test purchases)
